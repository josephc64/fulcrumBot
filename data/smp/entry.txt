Welcome to Season 1 of Coyote SMP, lasting from 6.1.2024 to 9.11.2024!

Coyote SMP is a Forge server running Minecraft version 1.20.1, and its
mods seek to expand the Vanilla Minecraft experience, adding many new
blocks, items, dimensions, bosses, game mechanics, and crafting recipes.

This modpack completely overhauls Minecraft's difficulty curve, throwing
greater challenges at the player, and many more opportunities to upgrade
gear and character strength. There is a greater focus in this modpack on
discovery and combat than grinding, and a number of item grinds have been
made much quicker.

Adventuring and farming have both been greatly enhanced, with many
in-game structures remodeled, plenty of new treasures and artifacts to
be found, and a great deal of new crops which are integral to player
growth.

Social features have also been greatly enhanced, with the introduction
of a mail system, musical instruments, new chat formatting, in-game proximity
voice chat, and fun new items.
